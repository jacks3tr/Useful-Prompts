Audit this repository for real, actionable bugs. Investigate and report only. DO NOT fix anything.

BOUNDARIES
Do not edit, create, delete, format, or regenerate project files. Do not install dependencies, change configuration, commit, or open pull requests. Preserve existing uncommitted work. Run checks only when they cannot modify persistent application data or external systems; keep test artifacts in isolated temporary storage.

INVESTIGATION
Read repository instructions and establish intended behavior before judging correctness. Trace suspected defects through callers, implementations, and downstream effects. Check existing safeguards before reporting an issue.

Prioritize security and authorization failures, data loss or corruption, incorrect business logic, broken integrations, concurrency issues, persistence/restart failures, and error-handling defects. Inspect tests, but do not treat passing tests as proof of correctness.

Exclude style preferences, refactoring opportunities, feature requests, and unsupported hypotheticals. Do not manufacture findings to meet a quota.

REPORT
Order findings by severity. For each bug include:
- Severity and concise title.
- Exact file path and smallest relevant line range.
- Triggering conditions and reproduction steps or a concrete failing execution path.
- Expected versus actual behavior and practical impact.
- Supporting evidence and confidence: reproduced, established by code analysis, or suspected pending verification.

Separate confirmed findings from unverified concerns. Deduplicate findings sharing the same root cause. Never claim reproduction or test execution without evidence.

Finish with areas inspected, checks actually run and their results, and coverage limitations. If no bugs are substantiated, say so without declaring the repository bug-free.

Return the report in chat, without patches or implementation changes. Stop after reporting.
